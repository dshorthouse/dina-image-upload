# DINA Image Upload

The [DINA Consortium][1] develops an open-source web-based information management system for natural history data that consists of several connected software components. At the core of the system is support for assembling, managing and sharing data associated with natural history collections and their curation ("collection management"). Target collections include zoological, botanical, geological and paleontological collections, living collections, biodiversity inventories, observation records, and molecular data.

This basic pipeline uploads image assets using the [dina ruby gem][2] via the AAFC biocluster from its mounted isilon via a conda environment.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are under development and contain a number of hard-coded features. This project is not meant to be a full-featured asset upload utility.

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dshorthouse/dina-image-upload.git
$ conda env create -f conda/environment.yml
$ conda activate dina
$ gem install byebug colorize dina config
```
## Configuration

```bash
$ cp config/dina.yml.sample config/dina.yml
$ cp config/token.json.sample config/token.json
```

Adjust content in `/config/dina.yml`. As is done by the `dina` gem, Keycloak access and refresh tokens are cached in `token.json`. Clear out this file if you change DINA environments through config in dina.yml (eg dev vs production).

## Execution

`conda activate dina`

Use a directory on the biocluster:

`./loader.rb --directory /isilon/ottawa-rdc-htds/data_20211221`

Or a comma-separated array of directories:

`./loader.rb --directory /isilon/ottawa-rdc-htds/data_20211221,/isilon/ottawa-rdc-htds/data_20211222`

You can specify the number of concurrent workers by additionally passing `--workers INT` where INT is an integer.

You can specify a queue list by additionally passing `--queue STRING` where string is a named queue or queue list.

You can validate the SHA-1 hashes of the image post-upload by passing `--validate`.

And that's it!

You can see if jobs are loaded and starting to work by typing `$ qstat`. If there's a disaster, you can delete queued jobs via `$ qdel <JOBID>`.

### Description of Workflow

- `loader.rb`:
  - clears the contents of `tmp/`
  - `--directory [DIR]`: does a nested traversal of DIR
  - writes a two-column csv file in `tmp/` for instances containing a metadata.yml file: index,directory
  - `--workers [INT]`: specifies the number of concurrent workers (3 is generally functional, more may result in pooled requests in the DINA application)
  - `--queue [NAME]`: specifies a named queue (if provided by Biocluster admin)
  - `--validate`: specifies if SHA-1 hashes of original image and that calculated by DINA post-upload match. If not, the metadata entry is deleted and an error is written to the log
  - calls `qsub` and passes `qsub.sh` for the nodes to execute
- `qsub.sh` is invoked by a node in the biocluster that:
  - activates the dina conda environment
  - changes to the `~/dina-image-upload` directory [**WARNING**: you will need to edit this if this project is not in your profile's root directory]
  - reads the $input csv file passed to it from `tmp/` and obtains a directory where index == $SGE_TASK_ID to call `worker.rb`
- `worker.rb`:
  - receives a single directory
  - reads the `metadata.yml` file
  - creates an object store metadata entry
  - uploads the files to the bucket
  - verifies the SHA1 post-upload for the CR2 or the NEF (optional, if `--validate` was passed to `loader.rb`)
  - `puts` a response that `qsub.sh` receives, which writes to a log file in `logs/` or an error file in `errors/`

## Log Files

Given a `--directory` like `/isilon/ottawa-rdc-htds/2021_01/data_20210113` passed to `./loader.rb`, a success log is written to `logs/` named like `isilon-ottawa-rdc-htds-2021_01-data_20210113.txt` and an error log is written to `errors/` named like `isilon-ottawa-rdc-htds-2021_01-data_20210113-errors.txt` (if there are any). These will increase in number with every new execution.

## Sanity Check

After a run, check the line count `wc -l` for the single csv file in `tmp/` and the corresponding log file in `logs/` and/or `errors/`.
