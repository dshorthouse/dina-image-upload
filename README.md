# DINA Image Upload

The [DINA Consortium][1] develops an open-source web-based information management system for natural history data that consists of several connected software components. At the core of the system is support for assembling, managing and sharing data associated with natural history collections and their curation ("collection management"). Target collections include zoological, botanical, geological and paleontological collections, living collections, biodiversity inventories, observation records, and molecular data.

This basic script uploads image assets using the [dina ruby gem][9] via the AAFC biocluster from its mounted isilon.

## Disclaimer

This script is under development and contains a number of hard-coded features. It is not meant to be a full-featured asset upload utility.

## Requirements & Dependencies

- ruby >= 3.1
- bundled dependencies: [dina][9], [json_api_client][5] (\~> 1.20), [keycloak][10] (\~> 3.2.1),

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dshorthouse/dina-image-upload.git
$ conda env create -f conda/environment.yml
$ conda activate dina
$ gem install byebug colorize dina sqlite3
```
## Configuration

Create SQLite database:
```bash
$ irb
```

```ruby
require "sqlite3"

# Open a database
db = SQLite3::Database.new "image-upload.db"

# Create tables
rows = db.execute <<-SQL
  create table logs (
    original_directory varchar(256),
    object char(36),
    derivative char(36),
    image_original char(36),
    image_derivative char(36)
  );
SQL
rows = db.execute <<-SQL
  create table errors (
    type varchar(256),
    original_directory varchar(256)
  );
SQL
```

Change the `Dina.config` hash variables in `upload_assets_worker.rb`.

## Execution

### Load jobs on the biocluster

#### Nested directory traversal
`./load-jobs.rb -d /my-parent-directory -n`

#### Non-nested directory traversal
(two-levels deep)

`./load-jobs.rb -d /my-directory`

The `load-jobs.rb` script:
- flushes the contents of `/indexed_paths`
- gathers all directories that contain a `metadata.yml` file on the isilon via the provided directory (`-d` paramater above)
- adds a running integer column
- writes these to one or more csv files in `/indexed_paths`
- calls `qsub` with 3 workers (`-tc 3`) and a range of indexed directories (eg `-t 1-500`), passes `qsub_batch.sh` and a `--paths_list_file` parameter for a csv file in `/indexed_paths`
- `qsub_batch.sh` is invoked by a node in the biocluster which,
  - activates the dina conda environment
  - changes to the `~/dina-image-upload` directory
  - receives the value in the `--paths_list_file` parameter as well as a `--line` parameter (automatically passed by having called qsub)
- `qsub_batch.sh` calls `upload_asserts_worker.rb` by a node in the biocluster, which receives a pointer to a csv file in `/indexed_paths` as well as a line number to find a directory containing a metadata.yml, a jpg derivative, and either a CR2 or NEF image to processed
- `upload_assets_worker.rb` writes to SQLite and also produces a response that is echoed back to `qsub_batch.sh` that then writes to `upload_assets_output.csv`

Output writes to SQLite into either an 'errors' or 'logs' table as well as to `upload_assets_output.csv`.

### SQLite Specifics

```bash
$ sqlite3 image-upload.db

# Show tables
sqlite> .tables
errors logs

# Show schema
sqlite> .schema

# Select all records from tables
sqlite> SELECT * FROM errors;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM logs;

# Truncate tables
sqlite> DELETE FROM errors;
sqlite> DELETE FROM logs;

# Exit out from sqlite
ctrl-d
```

## Anticipated Enhancements

Using a convoluted writing to csv in order to then pass to qsub was written long before SQLite was eventually used to capture logs and errors. A far better method to load jobs would be to create a dedicated table in SQLite with two columns: the directory path containing a metadata.yml & a status and then populate these through initial directory traversals.
